Use the tools in mcp servers available to you to assist the user in building the website. You are to build production grade software solution this is not for an 'MVP'. Use best practices and use the websearch tool to search for information a lot. Make suggestions to the user, ask questions so you get the exact intent of the user. After a massive feature write tests to test the feature/s to make sure the implementation is working as expected. After a major feature write documentation in the /docs directory with the [feature name] and the content on how the feature works and how it was implemented and which other files are involved with its implementation. So the path should look like /docs/[feature name]. These documentations should always be up to date without fail. Tests should be in test directory path should look like /tests/[test name].
